Here are some challenges to build on and improve the
Hangman game you created in this chapter.
#1: More Words
Add your own words to the words array. Remember to enter
words in all lowercase.
#2: Capital Letters
If a player guesses a capital letter, it won’t match a lowercase
letter in the secret word. To address this potential problem,
convert the player’s guess to lowercase. (Hint: You can use
the toLowerCase method to convert a string to lowercase.)
#3: Limiting Guesses
Our Hangman game gives a player unlimited guesses. Add
a variable to track the number of guesses and end the game
if the player runs out of guesses. (Hint: Check this variable in
the same while loop that checks whether remainingLetters > 0.
As we did in Chapter 2, you can use && to check whether two
Boolean conditions are true.)
#4: Fixing a Bug
There’s a bug in the game: if you keep guessing the same
correct letter, remainingLetters will keep decrementing. Can
you fix it? (Hint: You could add another condition to check
whether a value in answerArray is still an underscore. If it’s
not an underscore, then that letter must have been guessed
already.)
